    <p>
      I'm Matthew P. Gonkerwon, Jr., a passionate and dedicated Junior Software
      Engineering student currently studying at the Independent University of
      Kigali. Originally from Monrovia, Liberia, I have a strong foundation in
      software development, built through both academic learning and hands-on
      online experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      I completed my high school education at Cyber-Ed Christian School of
      Excellence in 2022, where I also had the honor of serving as Student
      Council President. Since then, I've been deeply involved in the world of
      programming and tech innovation, developing skills in project management,
      software development, leadership, and effective communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey has also been enriched by earning a Certificate in C
      Programming, and I'm continuously expanding my technical knowledge to
      become a well-rounded engineer. Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to
      solve real-world problems and aspire to contribute meaningfully to the
      tech community in Africa and beyond.
